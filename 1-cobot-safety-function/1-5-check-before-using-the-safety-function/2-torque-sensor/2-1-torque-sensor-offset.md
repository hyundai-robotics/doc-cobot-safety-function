# 1.5.2.1 Torque sensor offset

1\. **** After recording and modifying the step positions, run the program, and move the robot axes to a position that does not allow them to be affected by gravity.

In recovery mode, move each axis with the jog if a stop occurs because of a safety function violation. For more details on recovery mode, see “[**1.10.5 Recovery mode**.](../../1-10-safety-condition-monitoring/5-recovery-mode/)”
