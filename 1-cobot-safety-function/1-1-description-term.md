# 1.1 Description of terms

### <mark style="color:green;">Robot limiting parameters</mark>&#xD;

These are the parameters that constitute the criteria for monitoring the speed, force, and momentum of the robot.

*   **Tool center point (TCP) position monitoring**

    This monitors whether the safety tool model violates the safety space. In cases when the safety space is intruded into, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **TCP orientation monitoring**

    This monitors whether the tool orientation is out of the specified range. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **TCP speed monitoring**

    This monitors the speed of the tool tip. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **TCP force monitoring**

    This monitors the force of the tool tip. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **Power monitoring**

    This monitors the power of the robot. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **Momentum monitoring**

    This monitors the momentum of the robot. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **Collision detection**

    In cases when the allowable value is exceeded because of an external force applied to the robot, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **Safe operating stop (SOS) monitoring**

    This monitors whether the robot stops without any slips. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, Stop0 will be actuated. Meanwhile, when a stop condition is met while the robot is in the automatic mode, this function will be actuated automatically.

### <mark style="color:green;">Joint limiting parameters</mark>&#xD;

These are the parameters that form the reference for monitoring the position, speed, and torque of each robot joint.

*   **Joint angle monitoring**

    This monitors the position of each axial joint. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **Joint speed monitoring**

    This monitors the speed of each axial joint. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.
*   **Joint torque monitoring**

    This monitors the torque of each axial joint. In cases when the specified value is exceeded, the safety stop set by the user will be actuated.



### <mark style="color:green;">Safety layout</mark>&#xD;

These are the parameters for the safe space and the tool space that form the criteria for monitoring the TCP position and orientation.

*   **Safety space**

    This refers to the working space and the protected space of the tool.
*   **Working space**

    This refers to the space in which the robot carries out work. If the tool or the robot’s elbow model goes out of the working space, the safety stop function will be actuated.
*   **Protected space**

    This refers to the space where the operator should be safeguarded from the robot. If the tool or the robot’s elbow model goes out of the protected space, the safety stop function will be actuated.
*   **Safety tool modeling**

    The tool attached to the robot is modeled in spheres and cones to monitor the TCP position and orientation.
*   **Safety robot modeling**

    The robot’s elbow is modeled in spheres to monitor its distance from the safety space.



### <mark style="color:green;">Safety space</mark>&#xD;

This is the function that stops the robot if any safety conditions are violated. There are three methods for the safety stop. For more details on the methods, refer to ISO 13850 or IEC 60204-1.

*   **Stop0**

    The power of the motors of all the joint modules will disconnect immediately, and the motors will stop (uncontrolled stop).
*   **Stop1**

    The motors of all the joint modules will decelerate and stop, and the power of the motors will disconnect (controlled stop). The robot will decelerate as it continues to move along the programmed path, and then it will stop. As soon as the robot stops, its power will be disconnected.
*   **Stop2**

    The motors of all the joint modules will decelerate, and the safe operating stop (SOS) will take effect. The power supply status of all the motors will be retained.

### <mark style="color:green;">Recovery mode</mark>&#xD;

When the robot stops because of the safety function, you can clear the error and position the robot in the safe space while it is in recovery mode. However, when the safety board is in the FAULT state, the error cannot be cleared in recovery mode, and the system should be rebooted.



### <mark style="color:green;">Direct teaching</mark>&#xD;

This is a method in which teaching is performed by moving the robot directly. This function is actuated by a switch that is mounted on the robot.
