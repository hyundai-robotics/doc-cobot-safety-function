# 1.10.5 Recovery mode

In recovery mode, you can clear errors that occur because of the safety function violations during monitoring. Because position detection is temporarily disabled in recovery mode, you can drive the robot and adjust its angle and position without violating the safety functions.

If a safety function monitoring is violated, the robot will activate a safety stop immediately and stop moving. In addition, the safety stop notice window will appear on the operating program window.

1 .Set the operating mode to the manual mode.

2\. On the safety stop notice window, click the **\[ENTER]** button. Then, the safety condition monitoring window will appear.
