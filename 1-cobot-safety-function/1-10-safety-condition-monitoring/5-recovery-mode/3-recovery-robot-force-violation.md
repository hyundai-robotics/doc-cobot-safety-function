# 1.10.5.3 Recovery in case of robot force violations

Robot force violations are situations in which external force is applied on the robot or in which the amount of the force used by the robot internally exceeds a safety limit, and these include TCP force, collision detection, joint torque, power, and momentum monitoring violations. You can clear errors depending on the causes of the violations.
