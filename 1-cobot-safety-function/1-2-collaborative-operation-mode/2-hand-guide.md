# 1.2.2 Hand guiding

This is a method in which the operator holds and directly controls the robot’s manipulator. This method is available in the automatic operation mode.

To move the robot’s manipulator directly in the manual mode, you can use free motion and specific constraint motion by direct teaching with an external switch. For more details on direct teaching, see “[2. Direct teaching.](../../2-direct-teaching/)”
