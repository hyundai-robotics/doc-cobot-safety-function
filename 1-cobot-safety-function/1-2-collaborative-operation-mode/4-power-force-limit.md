# 1.2.4 Power and force limiting

This limits the impact on the human body in case of a collision. The collision detection function and the TCP force limiting function can limit the impact on the operator in case of a collision between the operator and the robot.

The collision detection function detects collisions according to the set sensitivity (%), while the TCP force limiting function restricts external force (N) applied to the TCP. You can also restrict the robot’s driving power by setting the electric power (W) and momentum (kg·m/s).

For more details on the setting of the robot’s safety conditions, see “[1.6 Robot safety conditions.](../1-6-robot-safety-condition/)”
