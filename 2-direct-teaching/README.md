# 2. Direct teaching

Direct teaching is a method of teaching the collaborative robot in which the teaching device attached to the manipulator is used for moving the robot directly. Because direct teaching specifies the robotâ€™s position by moving it directly, you can teach the robot in an intuitive manner without specialized knowledge.

Direct teaching methods include the free motion method, where all axes of the robot can be moved freely, and the constraint motion method, where the axes of the robot can be moved only in specific directions. The axial movement direction of the constraint motion method can be used by assigning it to the teaching switch of the robot manipulator.
