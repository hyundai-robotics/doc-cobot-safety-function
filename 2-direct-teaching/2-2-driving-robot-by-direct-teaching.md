**\[Caution]**

* Use the direct teaching functions in a safe environment only. If the tool or a nearby structure has a sharp part or a part that can cause entanglement, do not use the direct teaching functions.
* Before using the direct teaching functions, make sure to set the information on the tool, including the length, weight, and center of gravity. In addition, make sure to check the robot’s installation angle and direction of gravity.
* Set the enabling or disabling of the direct teaching functions only when the robot is at a complete stop. Changing the status of a direct teaching function while the robot is moving may cause the robot to malfunction.
